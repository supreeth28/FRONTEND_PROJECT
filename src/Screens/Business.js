               <h2><b>Business Process Outsourcing (BPO)</b> </h2>
               <p>BPO can be defined as the transfer of an organization's entire non-core but critical business process/function to an external business partner who uses an IT-based service delivery.


BPO helps an organization concentrate on its core competencies, improve efficiency, reduce cost and improve shareholders' value.
 Though IT outsourcing has been happening for so many years, an increased momentum has been witnessed since the late 1990's due to the rise of Internet and Communication technologies. 
 Several global giants from various industries have begun to realize the importance of BPO and have started outsourcing their non-core business functions. 
 This has given a break through to many specialized BPO business partners across the globe. 
The BPO market is expected to grow exponentially in the coming year.
